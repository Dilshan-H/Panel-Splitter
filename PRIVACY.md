# Privacy Policy for Panel Splitter for Adobe Photoshop

**Last Updated: April 14, 2025**

We prioritize your privacy and strive to be transparent about our data practices. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect data in **Panel Splitter for Adobe Photoshop** (the "Application"), particularly through our use of PostHog for analytics.

## 1. What Data Do We Collect?

To improve Panel Splitter, we collect anonymized usage data by default via PostHog, a third-party analytics platform (which is partially open source and less invasive than mainstream analytics services). You can disable this at any time in the Application’s settings. The data includes:

- **Usage Data**:

  - **Events**: Actions like starting the script, splitting panels, checking updates, or encountering errors.
  - **Script Parameters**: Details such as row/column counts, canvas size, or processing time.
  - **Error Logs**: Error types and messages to help us resolve issues.

- **System Information**:

  - Operating system version and architecture (e.g., Windows 11, x64).
  - Application version and locale (e.g., en-US).
  - Time zone and country code (based on system settings).
  - Hardware details: total RAM, free and total disk space on the system drive, and graphics card model

- **Unique Identifier**:
  - A randomly generated ID to track usage patterns anonymously, not linked to your identity.

**No Personal Data**: We do not collect names, email addresses, IP addresses, or any personally identifiable information (PII). All data is anonymized to protect your privacy.

## 2. How Do We Collect Data?

Analytics is enabled by default to help us enhance the Application. When active, Panel Splitter sends anonymized usage and system data to PostHog’s servers (hosted in the EU) during operations like running the script or checking for updates. You can disable analytics at any time in the settings, stopping all data collection immediately.

## 3. Why Do We Collect Data?

We use analytics to:

- Understand usage patterns to improve features and performance.
- Detect and fix bugs through anonymized error reports.
- Ensure compatibility across different systems and optimize update checks.
- Analyze hardware capabilities to enhance script efficiency and Photoshop integration.

This data helps us keep Panel Splitter free, reliable, and user-focused.

## 4. How Do We Use PostHog?

PostHog is our trusted analytics provider, enabling us to analyze usage data securely. PostHog:

- Stores data in the EU, following strict privacy regulations.
- Processes only anonymized data, with no access to personal details.
- Provides insights to make Panel Splitter better for everyone.

See PostHog’s [Privacy Policy](https://posthog.com/privacy) for more information.

## 5. Your Choices

- **Opt-Out of Analytics**: Analytics is enabled by default, but you can disable it at any time in the Application’s settings. Disabling stops all data collection after one last ping to the PostHog notifying opting out of data collection.
- **No Personal Data**: Since we collect only anonymized data, there’s no personal information to delete or manage.

## 6. Data Security

We protect analytics data with:

- Secure transmission to PostHog via encryption (HTTPS).
- Access limited to aggregated, anonymized insights by the Panel Splitter team.
- No sharing with third parties beyond PostHog for analytics.

## 7. Third-Party Services

PostHog is the only third-party service used for analytics. If we add other services later, we’ll update this policy and notify you.

## 8. Updates to This Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. The latest version is always on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Dilshan-H/Panel-Splitter). Significant changes will be announced via in-app notifications or release notes.
