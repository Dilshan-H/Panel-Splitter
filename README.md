## What is Panel Splitter?

Panel Splitter is a script that helps you to instantly crop images/canvas along the guides in Photoshop and export them as high quality PDFs. All you need to provide is how many rows and columns that are needed. Panel Splitter will prepare the guides, crop each panel and save them as PDFs for you!

## Simple Demo

Here's a example of what this tool can do:

## Why use Panel Splitter?

There is an alternative option that already available in Adobe Photoshop named `Slices from Guides`. But, it lacks the ability to export each panel in high quality state. (the `Export` feature is deprecated in modern versions as well). This tools helps in this situation by filling those gaps.

## How to use this tool?

1. If your Photoshop application is already opened, close and restart it. (First time only - to load the script to PS)
2. Open the image/canvas/panel
3. Please make sure to **save your document** and **keep a backup copy** for safety.
4. Go to `File > Scripts > Panel Splitter`
5. Provide a location to export the processed panels.
6. Input amount of rows and columns respectively in the next dialogs.
7. That's it.. After a moment, the script will show a message saying that the process is complete. Check the output location for PDF files.

## [ICYMI]: Important Notes for Users

- Always save your document before running this script!
- Make sure to keep a backup copy just in case, if something goes wrong.
